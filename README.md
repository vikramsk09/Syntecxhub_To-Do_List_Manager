📝 To-Do List Manager (Python CLI App)

A simple command-line To-Do List Manager built using Python that allows users to add, view, and delete tasks through a menu-driven interface.

This project demonstrates fundamental Python concepts such as lists, functions, loops, conditionals, user input handling, and basic error handling.

🚀 Features
1) Add new tasks
2) View all existing tasks
3) Delete tasks by selecting task number
4) Menu-driven interface
5) Input validation and basic error handling
6) Continuous loop until user chooses to quit

🛠 Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Built-in data structures (List)
- Exception handling (try-except)

📂 How to Run the Project
- Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git

- Navigate to the project directory:
cd your-repo-name

- Run the script:
python todo_app.py

🎮 How the Application Works
1) The user is presented with a menu:
-- 1. Add a new task
-- 2. View all tasks
-- 3. Delete a task
-- 4. Quit
2) Tasks are stored in a Python list during runtime.
3) When deleting a task:
- The user selects the task number.
- Input validation ensures only valid numbers are accepted.
- Proper index adjustment prevents off-by-one errors.

🧠 Concepts Practiced
- Functions and modular code
- Lists and indexing
- while loops
- if-elif-else statements
- Exception handling (ValueError)
- Basic CLI (Command Line Interface) design
- Off-by-one index handling

📌 Future Improvements
- Add task completion status (mark as done)
- Save tasks to a file (JSON or text) for persistence
- Add due dates
- Add task editing feature
- Convert into OOP structure
- Build a GUI version using Tkinter or a web version using Flask/FastAPI

🎓 Learning Outcome
- This project strengthens understanding of core Python fundamentals and introduces basic software structure using a menu-driven program.
